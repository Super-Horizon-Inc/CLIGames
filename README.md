This is a program using Command Line Interface platform to design based role playing games.




* The stories:

  * As a player I want to create a character
  * As a player I want to explore
  * As a player I want to gain experience through fighting
  * As a player I want to save and resume a game
  * And maybe more
  
* Technical constraints:
